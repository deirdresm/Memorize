#  Memorize

First project for Stanford's CS193p course, [which you can find here](https://cs193p.stanford.edu).

I like how Professor Paul Hegarty explains a few things, specifically the "constrains and gains" approach to development, e.g., by adding a protocol (e.g., Identifiable), that's a constraint, but it also gives you gains, too. Sort of like society that way.
